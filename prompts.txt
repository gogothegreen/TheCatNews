You are an expert in developing modern responsive web sites. I need your help with the following project. I will be running this on a Mac OS Sequoia. I also have VS code installed. I have some coding experience in Python, Perl, R, and shell script, but I am not a professional programmer. I need step by step and very clear instructions.

I have this code to convert a markdown document into a webpage. I want to modify the project to incorporate these additional features.

1. The Images section should be removed, only one image will be displayed at the top of the page. This image will always be the newest image in the file. It should span the entire width of the page.
2. The title of the page "TheCatNews" must appear on top of the image in large, translucent letters, such that the image is visible through the letters. The title should also be flashing in different colors.

Here is the README.md file for this project:

yes, this worked. However, the title "TheCatNews" should be a few times larger. I would also like it to be in 3D block letters, which are forward facing and turned towards the right. Also, they should flash in alternating, randomly chosen light and dark colors. Could you also please tell me how I can rotate through the latest 5 images in the directory, and display them one after at the current image position at the top of the page. The images must slowly fade in and out. While you are it, could you also tell me how to modify the rest of the document in such a manner:
1. All section headings must be in 3D balloon like letters, in a pastel color. Different section headings will be in different colors.
2. There should be more space between the different sections.
Also, please get rid of the "Welcome to TheCatNews" text.
Feel free to ask me any questions which might help you improve your answer. Thanks!

Please fetch me the latest news on cats from around the world. Divide it into sections, like "Cats and people", which will tell some news about helping a person; "Famous cats", which will talk about a trending or famous cat; "CatSci", which will talk about the latest research related to cats.
In your results, please also include the link for each piece of news.
Further, generate prompts to generate images for each section. The prompt should vividly describe the features of the cat mentioned in the article.
Thanks!

I would like to make the following additions to the site.
1. Every section should have the text and an image beside it. The text should occup two third of the width, and the image one third. The image should be taken from public/{section_heading}. The first section will have the article on the left and the image on the right. The next section will have the image on the left and the article on the right, and so on alternatingly for subsequent sections.
2. The link to the article should be within a text called <Link> at the end of the article. The link will be provided at the end of each section on the markdown file.
